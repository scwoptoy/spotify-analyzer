# Technical Decisions Log

This document tracks all significant technical decisions made during development.

## Decision 001: Monorepo Structure
- **Date**: 2025-05-28
- **Context**: Need to organize frontend and backend code
- **Decision**: Use monorepo with frontend/ and backend/ directories
- **Rationale**: Easier development, shared documentation, simpler deployment
- **Alternatives Considered**: Separate repositories for frontend/backend
- **Impact**: All code in single repository, easier to maintain consistency

## Decision 002: Docker for Development
- **Date**: 2025-05-28
- **Context**: Need consistent development environment across machines
- **Decision**: Use Docker Compose for local development
- **Rationale**: Eliminates "works on my machine" issues, easy onboarding
- **Alternatives Considered**: Local installation of dependencies
- **Impact**: All developers use identical environment, easier troubleshooting

## Decision 003: Tech Stack Selection
- **Date**: 2025-05-28
- **Context**: Choose technologies for frontend and backend
- **Decision**: React TypeScript + FastAPI Python + MongoDB
- **Rationale**: Modern, well-supported, good for music data analysis
- **Alternatives Considered**: Vue.js, Node.js, PostgreSQL
- **Impact**: Defines all subsequent development choices
