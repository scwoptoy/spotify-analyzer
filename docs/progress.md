# Development Progress Log

## Chat 1: Project Setup & Docker Configuration
**Date**: 2025-05-28  
**Duration**: Session 1  
**GitHub Issues**: #1-5

### Goals for This Chat
- [x] Create GitHub repository with professional structure
- [x] Set up Docker development environment  
- [x] Configure docker-compose for full stack
- [x] Test containers running together
- [x] Create professional development workflow

### Completed Today
- **Project Structure**: Created monorepo structure with frontend/backend separation
- **Repository**: Initialized GitHub repository with proper naming and description
- **Documentation**: Set up documentation structure with progress tracking
- **File Structure**: Created organized directory structure for scalable development
- **Complete Docker Environment**: Multi-container setup with frontend, backend, and database working together
- **Frontend-Backend Communication**: Successfully established API communication with error handling
- **Development Workflow**: Hot-reload development environment fully operational
- **Professional UI**: Modern React interface with Spotify-themed design and status monitoring

### Technical Decisions Made
- **Monorepo Structure**: Frontend and backend in same repository for easier development
- **Documentation-First**: Starting with proper documentation to maintain consistency
- **Professional Naming**: Using clear, professional naming conventions throughout

## Chat 2 In Progress ðŸš§ - Authentication System (Date: 5/28/25)

### Completed So Far
- âœ… Auth0 React SDK installed successfully
- âœ… Created Auth0 configuration structure
- âœ… Built authentication components (LoginButton, LogoutButton, UserProfile)
- âœ… Updated App.tsx with auth-aware layout and professional UI
- âœ… Configured Auth0Provider in main.tsx
- âœ… Created Docker PowerShell commands reference

### Currently Working On
- ðŸ”„ Testing frontend authentication flow
- ðŸ”„ Setting up backend authentication middleware
- ðŸ”„ Creating protected API endpoints
- ðŸ”„ End-to-end authentication integration

### Technical Decisions Made
- **Auth0 for Authentication**: Chosen for security, ease of integration, and future Spotify OAuth support
- **Component Architecture**: Separate auth components for clean code organization
- **UI/UX Design**: Professional dark theme with green accents matching Spotify branding
- **Environment Management**: Using .env.local for secure credential storage

### File Structure Added
```
frontend/src/
â”œâ”€â”€ components/Auth/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ LoginButton.tsx
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ LogoutButton.tsx
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ UserProfile.tsx
â”œâ”€â”€ config/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ auth0.ts
â””â”€â”€ .env.local (Auth0 credentials)
```

### Git Commits Made
1. `feat(deps): install Auth0 React SDK` - Added Auth0 dependency
2. `feat(auth): implement Auth0 frontend components` - Created auth UI components

### Testing Notes
- Frontend authentication UI components created
- Auth0 configuration structure in place
- Ready for authentication flow testing
- Backend integration pending

### Next Immediate Steps
1. Test frontend authentication flow
2. Set up backend authentication middleware (FastAPI + JWT)
3. Create protected API endpoints
4. Test complete end-to-end authentication
5. Document final authentication system

### Challenges & Solutions
- **NPM Warnings**: Received deprecation warnings during Auth0 install - these are normal and don't affect functionality
- **Environment Variables**: Set up proper .env.local structure for secure credential management

### Environment Variables Added
```
REACT_APP_AUTH0_DOMAIN=your-domain.auth0.com
REACT_APP_AUTH0_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id
```

### Ready for Next Phase
Once authentication system is complete, Chat 3 will focus on:
- Spotify API integration through Auth0 social connections
- Playlist data fetching and MongoDB storage
- Playlist display components with loading states
- Complete data pipeline from Spotify to frontend
